# insectarium

> An insectarium is a live bug zoo, or a museum or exhibit of live bugs.

This is a native desktop GUI for bug tracking.

Many of the web interfaces are slow and clunky, while the APIs
supporting them are fast.  This aims to be a streamlined way to
work your day to day tickets, without all the clutter and distraction
the web interfaces thrust on our lives.

# Currently supported/being added

- Jira Tickets
- Github Issues

# Setup

If using Arch Linux, ensure you are using java 12 which has openjfx,
or it will not work with the supporting lib (cljfx).

```
sudo archlinux-java set java-12-openjdk
```

Then you can install deps and run as follows:

```
cd gui
lein deps
```

## For Jira

First off, you will need to ensure you have some type of
authentication (a jira Oauth rest token, or, much easier - just copy
your Jira cookie out of a browser session and put in a file
Insectarium can load, such as: `/tmp/insectarium-jira-token.txt`).

This will work in all Jira use cases and is in general easier to set
up / prepare than the Oauth based flow (but note, it would be less
secure if this file were compromised in some way, so use at your own risk).

If you choose to, the file would end up looking similar to this:

```
cloud.session.token=eyJ...<many characteres of token>...mdQ
```

Afterwords, you can run:

```
lein run jira https://<your jira here>.atlassian.net
```

## For Github

You can run against Github as such (make sure to add some type of
github authentication, such as a github `user:password` for basic auth, into `/tmp/insectarium-github-token.txt`):

You can also use a personal access token instead of the password:

https://github.blog/2013-05-16-personal-api-tokens/

If you choose to, the file would end up looking similar to this:

```
example@example.com:somePasswordOrToken
```

Afterwords, you can run:

```
lein run github
```

# TODO

- Add proper authentication (OAuth support) for the various providers
